# JavascriptGame
Game made from JavaScript
This Webiste was made as a Project for my School Assignment in Grade 10 (2019), and has not been updated since then. 
This Website was made for the resolution 1920x1080 and will work as intended only on that resolution. 
I would recommend downloading the project and running the index.html file to test it out. 
But if for some reason you cannot download the file, you can try running the website here (https://saksham-p.github.io/JavascriptGame/).
Be aware that many components of the website don't work as intended on the GitHub Pages, including the game itself ^^^. 

This Website is made more for looks, rather than functionality. Functions like donating, or actually downloading another game is just for looks and asthetics.
